# MICCAI-2024-KPIs-Challenge-Task1 and Task2
These pre-training parameters are required for Task1 and Task2.

The parameters required for these two tasks are the same. You can try downloading them to the folder "/model/" and then try running docker.

The expected file structure should be:  

    model  
       -best_model.pth  
       -best_model_21.pth  
       -best_model_39.pth
       -best_model_47.pth
       -best_model_58.pth
       -best_model_73.pth
       -best_model_92.pth
       -best_model_101.pth
       -best_model_290.pth

These model parameters will be used as part of the voting model and ultimately vote to get the output results.
